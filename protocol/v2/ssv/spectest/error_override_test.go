// expectedErrorOverride contains mapping testName -> ("spec error" -> "error override substring(s)")
// that will be used to find and replace (if any) the error spectest expects (ExpectedError string)
// with a set of override substring(s) to match the actual error against.
// This mapping allows us to manually track/approve the exact differences between what spec
// tests expect vs what we actually have in our implementation so we can add details to
// our error messages (or use different error message altogether) without accidentally
// missing an important divergence from what spectests expect (which might happen if we don't compare
// error messages at all).
// For simplicity, the overriding pattern is just a bunch of substrings we expect actual error
// to contain.
