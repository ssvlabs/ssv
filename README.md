## âœ¨Introduction

SSV is a secure and scalable staking infrastructure powering the future of distributed ETH re/staking.

SSV uses an MPC threshold scheme with a consensus layer on top ([Istanbul BFT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.03613.pdf)),
that governs the network. \
Its core strength is in its robustness and fault tolerance which leads the way for an open network of staking operators
to run validators in a decentralized and trustless way.
