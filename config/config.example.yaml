# MEV Configuration (Optional)
# Duration to wait before requesting block proposal if this operator is proposer-duty Leader.
# This allows extracting higher MEV by waiting for better bids. Default is 0 (no delay).
# Recommended starting value: 300ms. See docs/MEV_CONSIDERATIONS.md for details.
# ProposerDelay: 300ms

# Safety flag to allow ProposerDelay values higher than 1s.
# WARNING: Values above 1s significantly increase the risk of missing block proposals!
# Only set to true if you understand the risks and have carefully read the MEV documentation.
# AllowDangerousProposerDelay: false
