# Differ :mag_right: :left_right_arrow: :mag:

Differ is a robust Go codebase comparison tool that enables you to easily identify relevant changes across codebases at a per-struct, per-function, and per-method level. With Differ, you can focus on the changes that matter and ignore the rest.

![Differ](https://dummyimage.com/600x200/000/fff&text=Differ)

## :sparkles: Highlights

- :zap: Swiftly compare symbols\* between two codebases, unaffected by differences in package paths or file names.
- :link: Automatically identifies corresponding symbols\* by parsing Go code with `go/ast`.
- :see_no_evil: Ignore changes considered irrelevant or approved.

_\* symbol: the name of a function, struct or method (symbol for methods are `<type>.<method>`)_

## :gear: Installation

### Quickly

Just `go install` and you're good to go!

```bash
go install github.com/ssvlabs/ssv/scripts/differ@latest
```

_Tip: you can replace `@latest` with `@any-git-branch`._

### Locally

After cloning the SSV repo, just `go install` from it.

```bash
cd ./scripts/differ
go install .
```

## :rocket: Usage

```bash
Usage: differ <left> <right>

Arguments:
  <left>     Path to the left codebase.
  <right>    Path to the right codebase.

Flags:
  -h, --help                    Show context-sensitive help.
      --config="config.yaml"    Path to the config file.
      --output="output.diff"    Path to the output diff file.
```

Example:

```bash
differ ./ssv ./ssv-spec
```

### ðŸ‘€ Reviewing

Differ provides a web UI to review the changes.

1. Copy & paste the contents of `output.diff` into [differ.vercel.app](https://differ.vercel.app) (or your local instance â€” see below)
2. Approve changes
3. Copy from `Change IDs` at the top
4. Edit `config.yaml` and append the IDs to `ApprovedChanges`

#### Locally Running the UI

After cloning the repo, install & run the Next.js project:

```bash
cd ./scripts/differ/ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

Check it out at http://localhost:3000

### Configuration

The `config.yaml` file is used to fine-tune the behavior of Differ.

```yaml
# List of approved change IDs to ignore.
ApprovedChanges: []

# Identifiers to ignore during comparison.
IgnoredIdentifiers:
  - logger

# Package names that should be reduced to their last component.
ReducedPackageNames:
  - ssv
  - qbft

# Pairs of packages to compare across the codebases.
Comparisons:
  - Packages:
      Left:
        - ./protocol/v2/ssv/runner
      Right:
        - ./ssv
    # User-defined hints for symbol matching. Maps from Left to Right.
    Hints:
      ReconstructSignature: PartialSigContainer.ReconstructSignature

  - Packages:
      Left:
        - protocol/v2/qbft/controller
        - protocol/v2/qbft/instance
      Right:
        - ./qbft
```
