# SSV Network Smart Contracts

### Intro | [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) | [Setup](docs/setup.md) | [Tasks](docs/tasks.md) | [Local development](docs/local-dev.md) | [Roles](docs/roles.md) | [Publish](docs/publish.md)

This repository contains the Solidity smart contracts for the SSV Network. The SSV Network is a decentralized network for the operation of Ethereum validators. It allows for secure, scalable, and decentralized staking on the Ethereum blockchain. The key elements of this system are represented through several Ethereum smart contracts, all of which are outlined below.

The documentation is divided into different sections:

- **Architecture** Provides an overview of the system and all its components.
- **Setup** The basic setup of the repository to be able to compile the contracts, run tests, etc.
- **Tasks** Detailed instructions to run useful tools, deploy, and upgrade the contracts.
- **Local development** Guide to setup the local environment to work with the contracts.
- **Roles** Detailed information about the privileged roles in the system.

## SSV Documentation

## Bug Bounty Program

SSV Network is committed to ensuring the security of our smart contracts. We've partnered with [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/) to host a dedicated bug bounty program.

If you believe you've identified a vulnerability in our smart contracts, we encourage you to report it via our [Immunefi Bug Bounty page](https://immunefi.com/bounty/ssvnetwork/). All submissions and communications regarding vulnerabilities will be managed by the Immunefi team.

Visit our [bounty page](https://immunefi.com/bounty/ssvnetwork/) to get detailed information on the types of vulnerabilities we're interested in, potential reward amounts, and the guidelines for participation.

Please note: Failing to abide by the participation guidelines may result in disqualification from the program and forfeiture of potential rewards.
